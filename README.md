# REST-ORM-ify
A package designed to easily expose [node-orm2](https://github.com/dresende/node-orm2) models as REST interface using [node-restify](https://github.com/mcavage/node-restify). Requires the use of the `restify.bodyParser` middleware.

Does not currently support relations (coming soon).

This has been tested against:

    "orm": "~2.1.17",
    "restify": "~2.8.1",

## Installation

```
npm i restormify
```

## Usage

```js
var restify = require('restify');
var orm = require('orm');
var restormify = require('restormify');

var server = restify.createServer();
server.use(restify.bodyParser());
orm.connect('some/db/string', function(err, db){
  db.define('todo', {
    task: String,
    completed: Boolean,
    deleted: {type: 'boolean', serverOnly: true},
    hiddenValue: {type: text, serverOnly: true}
  });
  db.sync('models', function(){
    
    restormify({
      db: db,
      server: server,
      apiBase: 'api',
      deletedColumn: 'deleted',
      allowAccess: function(req, method, resourceName, resourceId){
        return true;
      }
    });

    // OR:

    restormify(database, server);

    server.listen(3000);  
  });
});
```

This will expose `todo` as `/api/todo` responding to:

* `GET /api/todo`
* `GET /api/todo/[id]`
* `POST /api/todo`
* `PUT /api/todo/[id]`
* `PATCH /api/todo/[id]`
* `DELETE /api/todo/[id]`

## Options

The default options are:

```js
{
    apiBase: 'api',
    deletedColumn: 'deleted',
    allowAccess: function(){
      return true;
    }
  }
}
```

`options.apiBase`: what all requests to your API will be prefixed with.
`options.deletedColumn`: the name of the column to flag a piece of content as deleted. If set to `false` it **will destroy data in your database**
`options.allowAccess`: This method is called on each request. Returning `false` will return `401: Not authorized` to the client. It is passed in the restify `req` object, the name of the resource (and any ID), along with the HTTP method.

## Testing

```
> npm test

> restormify@0.0.1 test /Users/todd/src/restormify
